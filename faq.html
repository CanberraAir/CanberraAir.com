              They contain all sorts of toxins, and are so small that they can
              penetrate deep into the blood stream and all your body's tissues.
              Unlike large particles, your body has a much harder time filtering
              these particles out. Consistent high levels of PM2.5 exposure have
              been linked to a large number of health conditions, including
              respiratory trouble, heart disease, depression, and cancer.

              Absolutely not. Everyone is harmed by smoke pollution. Even if you

              serious long-term health problems.

              Not necessarily. PM2.5 particles are so small that they are
              difficult to smell, or see in the air. I have measured hazardous
              levels of PM2.5 in buildings which look and smell clear.

              Again, not necessarily. Some aircon systems filter out larger
              (e.g. PM10) particles, and cooler air can often feel nicer. Unless
              their aircon has
              <a href="#faq-hepa-filter">the right kind of filter</a>, the
              building may still have toxic levels of PM2.5. (My local gym had

              Air particles are measured in terms of "micrograms per cubic meter
              of air" (&micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>). In the ACT, AQI is calculated by
              multiplying the actual particle readings by 4. So a 50 ug/m<sup
                >3</sup

              There are several reasons for this:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Even though the actual particle concentration is the same,
                  different groups multiply this number by different amounts to
                  derive their AQI score. Because of this,
                  <em
                    >you can not compare AQI scores between apps or
                    organizations.</em
                  >
                  Instead you need to get that original PM2.5 concentration
                  number.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Many apps pull from the publicly available data on the

                  page. This data is a 24-hour rolling average of PM2.5
                  readings, and does not reflect the very latest air quality
                  readings. It can take 12+ hours for the ACT Health numbers to

                I've had many folks write in to point this out. While they say
                their PM2.5 readings are hourly, they are actually the 24 hour
                rolling average. You can verify this yourself by multiplying
                their PM2.5 numbers by 4, and getting the exact "24 hour rolling
                average AQI" value (ie. PM2.5 * 4 = AQI_PM2.5). It took me quite
                a while to get the real hourly data. (I asked them directly, and
                they declined to publish it themselves.)

              You need a mask rated for smoke particles. In Australia, this is
              listed as a <strong>P2 mask/respirator</strong>. For US products,
              these will be listed as "N95" or "P100" respirators. You will also
              need to ensure that the mask has a good, tight fit around yoru
              face. Read the package for instructions.

                Air purifiers are rated by
                <abbr title="Clean Air Delivery Rate">CADR</abbr> (Clean Air
                Delivery Rate) or
                <abbr title="Cubic meters per hour">m<sup>3</sup>/h</abbr>
                (cubic meters per hours). These values are used together with
                the area/volume of your room to figure out how many times per
                hour the purifier filters all your air, a number often called
                the <abbr title="Air changes per hour">ACH</abbr> (Air Changes
                per Hour).
              </p>

              <p>
                You want your purifier to filter all the air in your room at
                least 3 times per hour, though 5+ times is ideal. I have created
                a simple

                  >Air Purifier Power Calculator</a

                which can help you figure out what CADR (or m<sup>3</sup>/h)
                rating works best for your room/house.

              Every little bit still helps. You may also want to move into a
              smaller, or more airtight room. The more airtight your house is,
              the more effective your purifier will be.

                  If you have ducted heating, you can put your heater on FAN

                Consumer air quality monitors are nowhere near as accurate as
                lab equipment, but they can still be useful to get a sense of
                how bad it is, and to measure changes in conditions, such as
                when more smoke rolls in, or you've set up a new purifier in
                your home.
              </p>
              <p>
                I personally use the
                <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZVOmL5"
                  >Temtop M10 Air Quality Monitor</a
                >, and have found it to be convenient, portable, and accurate
                enough for personal use. When I turn on my purifier in my
                bedroom, for example, the numbers dropped from 600 (outside) to
                about 5 over the course of 25 minutes. (See

              Yes, the <a href="https://airrater.org">AirRater</a> app has
              hourly air quality readings. You can save your location and have
              the app notify you when the air starts getting bad.

                folks all around the ACT did this, we could have accurate AQI

                The <a href="https://aqicn.org/gaia/">Aqicn network</a> also has
                some good monitoring stations you can set up, though there
                aren't any running at present in the ACT, maybe you can be the
