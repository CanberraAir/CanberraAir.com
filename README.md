This page was put together in haste, to fill a pressing need. The code is a bit
spaghetti, but it works. All commits and comments welcome.


## TODOs (Would be happy for help on these)
- Switch data source from AirRater.org back to data.act.gov's new hourly data set.
- Integrate Purple Hour sub-hourly data for true real-time AQI updates.
